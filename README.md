# Difference Between `transactions` and `onchain_transactions`

| Table                | Purpose                                                                | Source                    | Used In        |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------|
| `onchain_transactions` | Represents raw transactions fetched from a blockchain (ETH, MATIC, etc.) | On-chain via indexers or RPC | Reconciliation |
| `transactions`         | Internal ledger activity: deposits, withdrawals, transfers, or reconciled entries | Internal system            | Ledger logic    |


To view raw data in the database, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# psql "postgres://test_xyz:test_xyzpass@localhost:55432/test_xyzledger"
# psql "postgres://xyz:xyzpass@localhost:5432/xyzledger"
